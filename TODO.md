### stuff that should happen

## week 1
- basics: lists, strings, int/float, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- batteries included: sorry, fiefdom-seekers, your bullshit utils methods have
already been written. time + datetime, join, split, http
- flow control, comprehensions, generators
- something cool
